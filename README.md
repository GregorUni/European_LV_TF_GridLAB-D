# European_LV_TF_GridLAB-D
GridLAB-D simulation of European Low Voltage Test Feeder with different cases of Load Profiles
In these folders you can find the files to run gridlab-d simulations for the base case of European test feader (from IEEE)
and a modified case with load for car charger of 20 kW in two specific moments of the day:
when base case was minimum total load power and when it was maximum.

##The current folders order/jerarqui is fundamental to run the scripts
##due to they take files saved in specific folders.
